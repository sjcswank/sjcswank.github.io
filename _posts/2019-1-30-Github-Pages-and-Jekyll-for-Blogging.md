I've been looking to start a blog to document my code-learning journey for a few months now. Like many of us just starting out, I've seen time and time again the importance of maintaining an online presence when trying to leap into the programing world. This is not particularly natural for me. My online life has always been rather private. So, a new blog seemed to be the easiest solution.

Well, "easy" may not be the best word for it. There were so many questions that needed answering that I didn't even know to ask. I did know I didn't want to host my blog on Wordpress but I didn't even know what other options were out there! Did I want to build my own blog? As a budding web developer it felt like cheating to use a platform I had no control over. Should I build something from scratch, use somekind of service? Where would I host this blog? So. Many. Questions.

My first instinct was to use what I already know. The last time I had a blog it was on LiveJournal, so I don't know much in the modern world. I do, however, know GitHub. And I know GitHub Pages. So I asked myself, is there a way I could create a blog using GitHub Pages? I could build my own blog without having to worry about things like paying to host it, or connecting to servers, or buying a domain name. What's better, I quickly learned, is that GitHub provides everything you need to get a blog going on their site! Perfect.

Which bring us to Jekyll. Jekyll is a website generator specifically designed to work with GitHub Pages. Jekyll creates __static__ websites which, if you remember that far back, is how GeoCities used to do it. There's no database needed, and the focus is completely on your content. No comments, no likes, no tags and filters (at least not on Github Pages) and no complex languages to learn. Easy Peasy.

Jekyll uses Markdown to format themes and posts. Mardown is similar to HTML but meant to be easier. There's plenty of customization you can impliment, and with user created themes and content editors like [Prose](https://prose.io) it can be as easy as you want to use Jekyll. At the same time, if you are like me and looking to practice or show off your web skills, you can write your own themes! The best of both worlds!

I was immediately sold. Honestly, I might have done a little more research, muttering things like "but that's so hard" or "that's not hard enough". I've been a real Goldilocks about this whole thing. Luckily, Jekyll was an easy to find good fit. and most importantly, it was super fast to get started.

I may have a slight issue with needing immediate gratification. I want what I want __now__. Or, at least, as soon as possible. Thanks to great tutorials like [this one](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) by [Barry Clark](http://www.barryclark.co/), this blog was up and running in just a few minutes. I'm not going to walk through the install process for you (Barry's already done that) but let me tell you, it was faster and easier than setting up a Wordpress. 

As of this post (my first post!) I have not had a chance to find a theme I like or, more likely, make one myself. I have set myself up to use the Jekyll build feature included in GitHub pages and Prose to edit content. I fully intend on moving everything local, maybe even trying my hand at writing my own content editor. I really do want to practice my development skills here. I'll be sure to keep up to date on here so anyone who feels like it can follow along with my journey.
