## About ME

<img style="float: right;" src="_images/icon.png">

I'm a 33 year old woman with one cat, four neices and nephews, and one great big desire to break into a programming career.

I started my programming journey in 2016 when I found a free programming class through the professional training organization [LaunchCode](https://www.launchcode.org/). I had always known that I liked working with HTML and CSS, but I was intimidated by the 'harder' coding languages. That class let me build my confidence and learn skills I wouldn't have even thought of on my own. Most importantly, it taught me how to seek out new and exciting technologies and how to learn them. 

Following that class I took up a position with LaunchCode as a Teaching Assistant for similar courses. Helping other learn the material really helped to confirm my knowledge and soldified my resolve in changing careers into programming. Since then I had completed an internship working with full-stack development technologies from java and sql to react.js and html. I also worked in PegaSystems development, with a focus on automation testing with Selenium and Cucumber. 

I am still growing my skills, as I will always do. I am a developer under constant development. Check out my [github](https://github.com/sjcswank) and [protfolio](https://sjcswank.github.io/portfolio/)!
